/*
 * Guest display and input for an embedder that runs QEMU inside its own
 * process.
 *
 * On a phone the emulator is a library, not a program: the app calls
 * qemu_init/qemu_main_loop directly. Its display therefore has no business
 * going through a socket. The stock way to show a guest here was a VNC server
 * on the loopback with the Raw encoding, which means the framebuffer is
 * compared, encoded, written, read, decoded and blitted — six passes over five
 * megabytes, all to move pixels a few kilobytes apart in the same address
 * space.
 *
 * This is the short way round: a display change listener keeps track of what
 * the guest has redrawn, and the app copies those rows straight out of the
 * surface. Nothing is encoded, and only what changed is touched.
